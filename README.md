# Flask Learning Project 🚀

## Introduction

Welcome to my Flask mini-project! This repository is designed as a hands-on learning experience for exploring Flask web development. As a BTech second year student, I've created this project to understand the fundamentals of web development using Python's Flask framework. This project includes user authentication, database operations, and basic web application structure.

## Features

✨ **What this project includes:**
- User registration and login system
- Session management
- Database integration for storing user data
- Notes/content management functionality
- Clean HTML templates for the frontend
- Modular code structure for better organization

## Folder Structure

```
Flask/
├── app.py          # Main Flask application file - contains routes and app configuration
├── db.py           # Database operations and connection handling
├── notes.py        # Notes-related functionality and logic
├── user.json       # User data storage (JSON format)
├── templates/      # HTML templates for the web pages
├── __pycache__/    # Python compiled bytecode (auto-generated)
└── README.md       # You're reading this! 📖
```

### Key Files Explained:

- **app.py**: The heart of the application! Contains all the Flask routes, handles HTTP requests, and manages the overall application flow.
- **db.py**: Manages database connections and operations. Handles data storage and retrieval.
- **notes.py**: Contains the logic for notes functionality - creating, reading, updating, and managing notes.
- **user.json**: Stores user information in JSON format for authentication and user management.
- **templates/**: Contains all HTML files that define how your web pages look and feel.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.6 or higher recommended).

### Steps to run:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FateboundSage/Flask.git
   cd Flask
   ```

2. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser and visit:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

🎉 **That's it!** Your Flask app should now be running locally.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Flask** - The web framework we're using
- **Basic knowledge of:**
  - Python programming
  - HTML basics
  - Understanding of web concepts (HTTP, routes, etc.)

### Installing Flask:
```bash
pip install flask
```
